### This project is part of the Statistical Foundation of Machine Learning course at Vrije Universiteit Brussels, supervised by Dr. Pieter Libin. It was undertaken by MirBagher Hosseini and Kimia Khaki. The objective of this project is to explore and provide answers to the following research questions:" 
#### 1. What is the comparative performance of ensemble methods (Random Forest and XGBoost) versus single models (Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, and Support Vector Machines) across a diverse range of datasets?
#### 2. What is the importance of data scaling in machine learning? How does it impact the performance of different algorithms?
#### 3. What is overfitting in machine learning? How can it be prevented? What are the different regularization techniques used in machine learning, and which one is considered better?
